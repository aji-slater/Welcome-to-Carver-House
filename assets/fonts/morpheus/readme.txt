
Kiwi Media, in their quest to beat the world into submission with fonts, 
presents...

MORPHEUS

So, you ask, what's the deal with this one?

Beats me.  I've agonized over a flourishing derscription of this one, and 
the best I can come up with is "I've been reading too many Sandman comics."

Not that this font actually appears in any Sandman comics.  But I was trying 
to get a mood here.  Something sort of neo-classical and ethereal, yet a bit 
on the creepy side.  

Whether or not I suceeded is another matter entirely.

If you like this font, send me money.  I ask $5 for this one.  Email me at 
wonko@itis.com, 
as I'm probably going to move soon after releasing this and it'd do me no 
good to start putting my address in if it's going to change.

All the rest of my fonts can be found on the WWW at

Enjoy.
